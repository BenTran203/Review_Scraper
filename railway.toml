# Railway deployment configuration
# Each service (gateway, scraper) should be deployed as a separate Railway service.
# Configure via Railway dashboard:
#   - Gateway: root directory = backend/gateway, set OPENAI_API_KEY env var
#   - Scraper: root directory = backend/scraper
#   - Redis: add Railway managed Redis plugin
#   - RabbitMQ: use CloudAMQP add-on or external CloudAMQP instance

[build]
# This file is for reference. Railway auto-detects Dockerfiles.
# Set the root directory per-service in the Railway dashboard.
